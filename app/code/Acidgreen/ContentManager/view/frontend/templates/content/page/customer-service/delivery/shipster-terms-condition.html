        <p dir="ltr">Don’t spend more time looking for ways to dodge shipping fees. You’ve found it with <span class="m_-6023405851803742647gmail-il">Shipster</span>; pay once and spend more on shopping and less on shipping.</p>
        <h3 dir="ltr"></h3>
        <h3 dir="ltr">How does it work?</h3>
        <p dir="ltr">Shipster is new and only $9.95 for free shipping for a two month free trial, automatically rolling on to $6.95-a-month until you opt out.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">Once you have signed up to <span class="m_-6023405851803742647gmail-il">Shipster</span>, all you need to do is shop online with any participating merchant, and the merchant will verify your membership by your email address at the checkout phase. You will just need to enter the same email address you signed up to <span class="m_-6023405851803742647gmail-il">Shipster</span> with, and free delivery will be automatically applied.</p>
        <h3 dir="ltr"></h3>
        <h3 dir="ltr">How do I qualify for free shipping?</h3>
        <p dir="ltr">1. Your shopping cart needs to be at least $25.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">2. You shipping costs don’t normally exceed $20.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">3. Delivery Nationally within Australia.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">4. You opt for Standard Delivery only.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">5. Your order does not include large items.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">If free shipping isn’t applied at the checkout phase as expected, it’s worth checking that the email address you have entered at the online checkout is the same one they entered when signing up for <span class="m_-6023405851803742647gmail-il">Shipster</span>.</p>
        <h3 dir="ltr"></h3>
        <h3 dir="ltr">Tracking:</h3>
        <p dir="ltr">Items purchased with participating <span class="m_-6023405851803742647gmail-il">Shipster</span> retailers may be delivered by Australia Post, or by other carriers. This will depend on which carriers are used by the retailer.</p>
        <p dir="ltr">If you have an Australia Post tracking number, you can track your parcel through the Australia Post tracking page. Otherwise, you can visit the carrier’s website to track your parcel.</p>
